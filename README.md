# Vending Machine Locator Web App
*Work in progress*

## High-Level Abstract

The web application is intended to be a community-driven/community-contributed project. Users submit their findings of vending machines in the real world and upload them to this site.
Other users can view these submissions and be able to route themselves to the location of the findings.

### Architecture

Using React front-end, java and SQL back-end.

##### Implementations still being worked on

Eventually the goal is to have Google Maps API calls so that the submissions can be pinned onto an interactive map and be able to use Google Maps to find the path to the location that was submitted.
User profile creation is coming soon.
